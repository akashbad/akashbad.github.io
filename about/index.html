<p>
Hi there, I'm Akash Badshah and this is my blog about projects that I'm working on and any other random observations I might have.
</p>

<p>
I'm a recent MIT graduate (Class of 2015 turned 2014) where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Throughout MIT and beyond I've grown deeply interested in technology and how it is constantly changing the way things work. I love to code and (when I get the chance) working with hardware in order to make cool experiences and solve interesting problems. Check out my <a href="http://github.com/akashbad">Github</a> to see some of the projects I'm currently working on.
</p>

<p>
I'm also big into startups and am currently working on <a href="http://socedo.com">Socedo</a>. At Socedo we are building the next generation of sales and marketing tools which utilize the conversations people are having on the social web to discover prospects and automatically qualify them for salespeople. In addition to the many shared responsibilities at a small startup, I am particularly involved in new API integrations and feature development as well as helping to dictacte our overall user experience and design.
</p>
<p>
I'm a Seattle native and love the Pacific Northwest. Beyond engineering I love snowboarding, hiking, and spending time on boats. Check out my favorite music on <a href="http://hypem.com/akashbad">The Hype Machine</a>.
